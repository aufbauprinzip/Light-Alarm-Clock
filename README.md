# Light-Alarm-Clock

ESP8266 microcontroller with DS3231m to control an RGBW LED strip and turn it into a web interfaceable light alarm (Lichtwecker!)

## Idea

Making an DIY light alarm with a RGBW LED strip. The light alarm will simulate the sunrise the sunrise to wake you up softly.

## Setup & Functions

In this project I used an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266, with DS3231m RTC to control a RGBW LED strip. The microcontroller is connected to the home WiFi network and can be controlled from any device that can run a browser.
